# Complex PowerBI report
In this repository you can see screenshots of complex Power BI report. My task here was to create Power BI report from data in xlsx file. Data wasn't prepared so I needed to write macros that created dataset that can be used in Power BI. I also wrote macros for adding new data into dataset when new data appears (it updates not the whole dataset, but adds new data to dataset to minimize time of completion). Using Power Query I modified data, added new custom columns and created two additional tables. In Power Pivot created the model, then created report and added complex custom conditional formatting that uses DAX to figure out colors in tables. Client was provided with xlsx file with dataset, pbix file, videos on how install data gateway and set up scheduled refresh.
